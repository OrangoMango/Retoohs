## How to play
Check out the screenshots and the in-game tutorial!  
**Quick notes:** You switch roles every 20s, when you are the player you need to kill the zombies and collect the blue points; don't get too OP because when you play as the zombies you need to defeat yourself and avoid letting the player to score points (try to collect the drops and to dodge the player's bullets). At 1500 you meet your first boss.
